        <p>
        HTML, oh HTML, how broken you are <br>
        Your syntax so convoluted, your tags so bizarre <br>
        Your semantic meaning, oh so unclear <br>
        Making it difficult to know what's held dear <br>
 <br>
        Your presentation and content, they're intertwined <br>
        Making it hard to change one without the other intertwined <br>
        Your interactive elements, oh so limited <br>
        It's a struggle to create them, we're so inhibited <br>

        But still we use you, HTML, every day <br>
        Despite your flaws, you never go away <br>
        You're the foundation of the web, we can't deny <br>
        HTML, oh HTML, you'll never truly die <br>

        So here's to you, HTML, warts and all <br>
